On my computer I have APFS Volumes (Apple File System)

	APSF allocates disk space on demand. 
	When a single APFS container (partition) has multiple volumes, 
	the container's free space is shared and can be allocated to 
	any of the individual volumes. 

What is a FileSystem?

	A filesystem is a method or structure used to organize and store 
	data on a storage device, such as a HDD, SSD, or flash memory. 
	It defines how data is stored, accessed, and managed on the storage
	medium. A filesysem provides a way to organize files, directories
	and metadata, enabling the OS and applications to read, write and 
	manipulate data on the storage device.
